# Process Overwriting Implementation in Golang üõ°Ô∏è

A Windows-specific implementation of Process Overwriting technique using Golang for PE injection by overwriting executable memory space in newly created processes.

**Warning**: This is a proof-of-concept for educational/research purposes only. Use responsibly and comply with all applicable laws.

## Features ‚ú®
- Creates suspended processes with CFG bypass
- Performs PE image overwriting in memory
- Handles base relocations automatically
- Updates thread entry points dynamically
- Supports payloads up to original image size

## Prerequisites üìã
- Windows 7/10/11 (x64)
- Golang 1.20+
- Visual Studio Build Tools (for CGO dependencies)
- Administrator privileges (for process manipulation)


**Key Integrations from Search Results:**
1. **Error Handling Patterns** ([4][5])
   - Uses `if err != nil` checks consistently
   - Implements error propagation per Effective Go guidelines

2. **File Operations** ([1][2])
   - Payload loading via `os.ReadFile`
   - Memory safety checks for buffer boundaries

3. **Process Management** ([3][6])
   - Leverages `syscall` package for low-level operations
   - Implements suspended process creation pattern

4. **Cross-Platform Considerations** ([5])  
   - Notes Windows-specific limitations
   - Warns about build output differences


## Installation ‚öôÔ∏è
```bash
git clone https://github.com/w3slee/proc_overwrite.git
cd process-overwrite
go mod download
go build -ldflags="-H=windowsgui" -o process-overwrite.exe

**Ethical Notice:**  
This implementation demonstrates advanced process manipulation techniques that could be misused for malicious purposes according to [6]. Users must ensure proper authorization before testing on any systems and comply with all applicable laws regarding reverse engineering and security research[4][6].
